				The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly-updated report outlining security concerns for web application security,
				focusing on the 10 most critical risks.
				First version released in 2004. (tell about versions : then in 2007,2010,2013. Last version in 2017)

				A1. Injection
				<section>
					<p>
						injection vulnerability is when an attacker sends malicious data as part of a command or query
						to an interpreter.
						If successful, this malicious input will be executed as code,
						causing the interpreter to execute unintended commands or reveal data which should otherwise be
						inaccessible.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p><b>When app is vulnerable?</b></p>
					<br>
					<p>When website’s failure to filter, validate or sanitise a user’s input.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						How to prevent?
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Filtering, Validating, Encoding and Escaping</li>
							<li>Query Parameterisation</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3></h3>Examples
					<div style="font-size: 25px">
						<p>- Valve paid out $25,000 after an SQL injection was reported in report_xml.php through
							countryFilter[] parameter. An unvalidated parameter on an partner reporting page (report_xml.php) could be used to read
							certain SQL data from a single backing database.</p>
						<p>- Formidable Pro, plugin for WordPress. It was able to gain read access on wordpress database
							and provided us all the relevant details (PoC) required for us to reproduce the issue.</p>

				A2. Broken Authentication
				<section> This class of vulnerability covers any weaknesses in the authentication/session management
					methodology.</section>
				<section> When app is vulnerable?
					<ul style="font-size: 25px">
						<li>Failure to deny automated attacks (brute-forcing, credential stuffing etc).</li>
						<li>Allows users to have weak or well-known passwords such as password123.</li>
						<li>Exposes username/password information based on error messages/response times.</li>
						<li>Implements weak credential recovery and forgotten-password measures. (An interesting article
							on the weak nature of security questions was published by the NCSC here).</li>
						<li>Exposes Session IDs in URLs.</li>
						<li>Fails to implement Session ID switching after a user logs in.</li>
						<li>Sessions remain active for too long — after a session has exited and remained inactive for a
							significant period of time.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section> how to prevent
					<br>
					Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) for all logins <br>
					Ensuring users have sufficiently-strong passwords by implementing validation on password creation.
					<br>
					Rate-limit login attempts<br>
					Blacklist IPs<br>
					strong Session ID, server-side created, not uncluded in URL
				</section>
				<section> example <br>
					- Uber failed to rate-limit the https://biz.uber.com/confirm endpoint,
					which would allow an attacker to brute-force business accounts and take rides on behalf of them.
